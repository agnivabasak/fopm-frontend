This tool will have features like adding people to an organization/company, inviting specific members to join a specific team for different projects, assigning admins for each team, assigning tasks to each specific team and thus giving tasks to the members involved in these teams.<br> The tasks can there after be organized into separate categories through an intuitive GUI like assigned, in progress, in review and completed.Another major feature of this project would be that at the end of the project, the manager of each project can see the performance of each member in the project displayed in an intuitive way.
